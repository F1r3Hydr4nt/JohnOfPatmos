# The Plan
Ah, I understand now! You have a successful decryption that produces scrambled output due to CAST-128 internal state manipulation. This is a much more sophisticated sabotage mechanism. Here's the systematic approach:
Phase 1: Capture the Good Decryption Output
1. Memory Dump Strategy
bash# In QEMU with GDB
(gdb) break *[address_after_decryption_completes]
(gdb) dump memory decrypted_data.bin [start_addr] [end_addr]
2. Ghidra-Based Output Location

Find the CAST-128 implementation in Ghidra
Locate where decrypted data is written (output buffer)
Identify the memory region that should contain plaintext
Set breakpoints at the end of the decrypt function

3. UART/Console Interception
If the decrypted data goes to UART:

Find the UART write functions in Ghidra
Set breakpoints before data goes to serial output
Capture the scrambled vs expected output

Phase 2: Identify CAST-128 Sabotage Mechanism
CAST-128 Vulnerable Points:

Key schedule corruption: Modifying the 32 subkeys during key expansion
S-box tampering: Altering the substitution boxes
Round key modification: Changing keys between rounds
Register state pollution: Corrupting intermediate values during encryption/decryption

Ghidra Analysis Strategy:
1. Locate CAST-128 implementation:
   - Search for CAST constants (magic numbers, S-box values)
   - Find key scheduling routines
   - Identify the main encrypt/decrypt loops

2. Map sabotage insertion points:
   - Look for conditional code that modifies CAST state
   - Find where "bad" input triggers different key handling
   - Trace memory writes to CAST context structures
Phase 3: Reverse Engineering the Sabotage
1. Static Analysis in Ghidra

Compare normal CAST-128 implementation with this version
Look for additional conditional branches in decrypt routine
Find where sabotage decision is made (before decryption starts)

2. Dynamic Analysis Plan
Good decryption run:
- Dump CAST-128 subkeys before decryption
- Dump intermediate round values
- Capture final output

Bad input run (that triggers sabotage):
- Dump the same values
- Compare to identify exact modifications
3. Sabotage Pattern Identification
Common CAST-128 sabotage techniques:

XOR key schedule with constant
Bit rotation of subkeys
S-box entry swapping
Endianness manipulation

Phase 4: Undoing the Sabotage
Option 1: Patch the Sabotage Logic
In Ghidra:
- NOP out the sabotage instructions
- Force conditional branches to take "good" path
- Export patched kernel for testing
Option 2: Runtime Correction
Using GDB:
- Break before CAST-128 key schedule
- Restore correct key values
- Continue with proper decryption
Option 3: Post-Sabotage Correction
If you can map the exact sabotage transformation:

Let sabotage occur
Apply reverse transformation to recover correct data
This might be easier than preventing sabotage

Implementation Strategy
Step 1: Use GDB to dump the decrypted output buffer after good decryption
Step 2: Compare CAST-128 key schedules between good and sabotaged runs
Step 3: Identify the exact transformation applied during sabotage
Step 4: Implement the reverse transformation or patch the sabotage
Key Questions for Your Analysis:

Do you see the same scrambling pattern each time, or is it randomized?
Is the sabotage applied to keys, S-boxes, or intermediate values?
Does the scrambling happen during key expansion or during actual rounds?

Would you like help setting up the GDB memory dumping strategy, or should we focus on identifying the CAST-128 implementation in Ghidra first?
